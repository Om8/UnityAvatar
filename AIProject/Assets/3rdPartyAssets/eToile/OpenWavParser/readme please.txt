Hi, first of all: thank you for downloading OpenWavParser.
I'm sure it will make your developer's life easier.

Before start with the test application, please extract the "ExtractMeToStreamingAssets.zip" file into the "StreamingAssets" folder.
The "StreamingAssets" folder is a special Unity fodler, you know? It must be right in the "Assets" folder, otherwise Unity will not find it.
NOTE: This "StreamingAssets" content is not important, it's just for demonstration purposes and can be deleted.

Please take a look at the documentation, it's short and clear.

Thanks again.
